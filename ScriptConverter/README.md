# Overview
This is a program to convert IScripts into JE Scripts.

## Current Progress
- Can create an xml file that kind of looks like a normal JE Script.
- Currently handles most kinds of text (regular dialogue, big text boxes, choice boxes)

## Currently Working On
- Reworking how I handle jumpz codes
- Trying to find a few more codes that dertermine dialogue logic
